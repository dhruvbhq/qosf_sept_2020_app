# qosf_sept_2020_app

This is Dhruv Bhatnagar's submission for QOSF Mentorship programme (Initial screening task), September 2020.

I have attempted task 1 of the 4 provided screening tasks.  This task involves optimizing the parameters of a variational quantum circuit (with alternating rotation and entanglement blocks) so that its output comes as close as possible to a random quantum state. The effect of increasing the number of layers in the circuit ansatz is to be shown via a plot.

I have also tried experimenting different types of rotation blocks in the odd layer of the circuit to observe their behaviour, as mentioned in the bonus question.

The .ipynb notebook contains the problem statement and my solution. (QOSF is credited with the problem statement and problem figures in the notebook).

If the notebook does not load on Github, there are the following alternatives:

* View it on nbviewer (no download required): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhruvbhq/qosf_sept_2020_app/blob/master/notebook_task1_executed.ipynb
* View the attached pdf file (although it is not well-rendered).
* Contact me; I would me happy to email the notebook to you.
