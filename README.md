# qosf_sept_2020_app

This is Dhruv Bhatnagar's submission for QOSF Mentorship programme (Initial screening task), September 2020.

I have attempted task 1 of the 4 provided screening tasks. 

The .ipynb notebook contains the problem statement and my solution. (QOSF is credited with the problem statement and problem figures in the notebook).

If the notebook does not load on Github, there are the following alternatives:

* View it on nbviewer (no download required): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhruvbhq/qosf_sept_2020_app/blob/master/notebook_task1_executed.ipynb
* View the attached pdf file (although it is not well-rendered).
* Contact me, I would me happy to email the notebook to you.
